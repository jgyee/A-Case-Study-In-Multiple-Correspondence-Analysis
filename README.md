This repository contains both the output (pdf or .docx file) and R code (in the .Rmd file) for a statistical research paper, A Case Study in Multiple Correspondence Analysis: Clicker Question Responses to Cluster Different Types of Students. Starting with anonymous raw data, I wrangled and cleaned the data to perform exploratory analysis on clicker question responses from undergraduate statistics students. My primarily method of analysis was Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), a dimensionality reduction technique similar in nature to Principal Components Analysis (PCA), but specifically designed to handle categorical variables.
